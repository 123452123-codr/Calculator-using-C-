The Offline.cpp has been made for Offline C++ compilers and has been successfully tested for MS Turbo C++. We recommend to use this compiler for running Offline.cpp.

The Online.cpp has been made for Online C++ compilers and can run on any of them.

Note: You may have some problems while running Online.cpp in online compilers because as a general rule, online compilers have a lower accuracy than offline compilers. So you may need to run it again to get the correct results.
